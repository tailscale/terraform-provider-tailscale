# HuJSON - Human JSON

The HuJSON decoder is a JSON decoder that also allows

- comments, both `/* ... */` and `// to end of line`
- trailing commas on arrays and object members

It is a soft fork of the Go standard library `encoding/json` package.
The plan is to merge in all changes from each Go release.

Currently HuJSON is based on Go 1.13.
