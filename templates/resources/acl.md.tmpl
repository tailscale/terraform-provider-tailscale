# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> **Note:** The naming of this resource predates Tailscale's usage of the term "policy file" to refer to the centralized configuration file for a tailnet. This resource controls a tailnet's entire policy file and not just the ACLs section within it.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "examples/resources/%s/import.sh" .Name)}}
