# Tailscale Provider

This provider is used to interact with resources supported by the [Tailscale API](https://tailscale.com/api).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tailscale = {
      source  = "tailscale/tailscale"
      version = "<version>"
    }
  }
}

provider "tailscale" {
  oauth_client_id      = "my_client_id"
  oauth_client_secret  = "my_client_secret"
  tailnet              = "example.com"
}
```

## Authentication

There are several ways to authenticate the Tailscale provider with the Tailscale API.

Using a [trust credential](https://tailscale.com/kb/1623/trust-credentials) (an OAuth client or federated identity) is
recommended whenever possible as trust credentials can have granular access scopes applied to them whereas API keys cannot.

Available authentication methods are detailed below.

### OAuth clients

[OAuth clients](https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/oauth-clients) can be used for authentication by setting the `oauth_client_id`
and `oauth_client_secret` arguments in the provider configuration to the client ID and client secret of a configured OAuth client
respectively:

```terraform
provider "tailscale" {
  oauth_client_id     = "my_client_id"
  oauth_client_secret = "my_client_secret"
  tailnet             = "example.com"
}
```

See [argument reference](#argument-reference) for more details.

### Federated identities

[Workload identity federation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1581/workload-identity-federation) can be used for authentication
by setting the `oauth_client_id` and `identity_token` in the provider configuration to the client ID of a configured
federated identity and a JWT identity token from a compatible issuer respectively:

```terraform
provider "tailscale" {
  oauth_client_id = "my_client_id"
  identity_token  = "my_identity_token"
  tailnet         = "example.com"
}
```

See [argument reference](#argument-reference) for more details.

### API keys

[API keys](https://tailscale.com/kb/1101/api#authentication) can be used for authentication by setting the `api_key`
argument in the provider configuration:

```terraform
provider "tailscale" {
  api_key = "my_api_key"
  tailnet = "example.com"
}
```
See [argument reference](#argument-reference) for more details.
