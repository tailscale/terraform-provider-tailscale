# tailscale_acl (Data Source)

The acl data source gets the Tailscale policy file for a tailnet

~> **Note:** The naming of this data source predates Tailscale's usage of the term "policy file" to refer to the centralized configuration file for a tailnet. This data source fetches a tailnet's entire policy file and not just the ACLs section within it.
