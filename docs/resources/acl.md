# tailscale_acl (Resource)

The acl resource allows you to configure a Tailscale ACL. See https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls for more information. Note that this resource will completely overwrite existing ACL contents for a given tailnet.

If tests are defined in the ACL (the top-level "tests" section), ACL validation will occur before creation and update operations are applied.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "tailscale_acl" "as_json" {
  acl = jsonencode({
    acls : [
      {
        // Allow all users access to all ports.
        action = "accept",
        users  = ["*"],
        ports  = ["*:*"],
      },
    ],
  })
}

resource "tailscale_acl" "as_hujson" {
  acl = <<EOF
  {
    // Comments in HuJSON policy are preserved when the policy is applied.
    "acls": [
      {
        // Allow all users access to all ports.
        action = "accept",
        users  = ["*"],
        ports  = ["*:*"],
      },
    ],
  }
  EOF
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `acl` (String) The policy that defines which devices and users are allowed to connect in your network. Can be either a JSON or a HuJSON string.

### Optional

- `overwrite_existing_content` (Boolean) If true, will skip requirement to import acl before allowing changes. Be careful, can cause ACL to be overwritten

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# ID doesn't matter.
terraform import tailscale_acl.sample_acl acl
```
