# tailscale_acl (Resource)

The acl resource allows you to configure a Tailscale ACL. See https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls for more information. Note that this resource will completely overwrite existing ACL contents for a given tailnet.

If tests are defined in the ACL (the top-level "tests" section), ACL validation will occur before creation and update operations are applied.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "tailscale_acl" "sample_acl" {
  acl = jsonencode({
    acls : [
      {
        // Allow all users access to all ports.
        action = "accept",
        users  = ["*"],
        ports  = ["*:*"],
    }],
  })
}
```
