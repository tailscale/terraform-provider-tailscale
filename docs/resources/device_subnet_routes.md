# Resource `tailscale_device_subnet_routes`

The device_subnet_routes resource allows you to configure subnet routes for your Tailscale devices. See the
[Tailscale subnets documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "tailscale_device" "sample_device" {
  name = "device.example.com"
}

resource "tailscale_device_subnet_routes" "sample_routes" {
  device_id = data.tailscale_device.sample_device.id,
  routes = [
    "10.0.1.0/24",
    "1.2.0.0/16",
    "2.0.0.0/24",
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `device_id` - (Required) The device to change enabled subroutes for.
- `routes` - (Required) The subnet routes that are enabled to be routed by a device. Routes can be enabled without a 
  device advertising them (e.g. for preauth).
