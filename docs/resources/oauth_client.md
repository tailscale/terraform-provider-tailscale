## Schema

### Required

- `scopes` (Set of String) Scopes to grant to the client. See https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/ for a list of available scopes.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the key consisting of alphanumeric characters. Defaults to `""`.
- `tags` (Set of String) A list of tags that access tokens generated for the OAuth client will be able to assign to devices. Mandatory if the scopes include "devices:core" or "auth_keys".

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation timestamp of the key in RFC3339 format
- `id` (String) The client ID, also known as the key id. Used with the client secret to generate access tokens.
- `key` (String, Sensitive) The client secret, also known as the key. Used with the client ID to generate access tokens.
- `user_id` (String) ID of the user who created this key, empty for OAuth clients created by other OAuth clients.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Note: Sensitive fields such as the secret key are not returned by the API and will be unset in the Terraform state after import.
terraform import tailscale_oauth_client.example k1234511CNTRL
```
